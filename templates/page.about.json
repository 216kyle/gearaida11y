The patched-up hole in your waders is when you were fishing in Bighorn River and slipped on a rock when you were after that elusive catch. The stitching on the top of your tent isn’t an imperfection, it’s a memory of the time it hailed on your trip to Zion and you had to cover the giant hole up with jackets just to keep dry until morning.<\/p><p>We aim to empower all outdoor lovers to commit to your gear long-term—not only for the stories, but for the benefit of the earth itself. That’s why we teach you how to seal, clean, and patch every last bit of outdoor gear that you own, keeping it in your pack and out of the landfill.<\/p><p>So, here’s to your journey in the great outdoors—may it be restorative, long-lasting, and may we come along with you to make it easier.<\/p>","padding_top":true,"padding_bottom":false,"border_top":false,"border_bottom":false,"btn_label":"","btn_url":""}},"07eace9f-20fa-4130-8f82-89532e91df7f":{"type":"heading-block","settings":{"title":"OUR PRODUCTS REPAIR, FIX, CLEAN, PROTECT, SEAL, PATCH, AND SEW YOUR GEAR.","image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/about-heading-bg.png","min_height":"455","padding_top":true,"padding_bottom":true,"border_top":false,"border_bottom":false}},"643d321f-e51c-44af-9221-953e3c204e38":{"type":"text-block","settings":{"block_title":"\/  Mission","title":"GEAR AID CHAMPIONS RENEWAL FOR THOSE WHO PLAY AND WORK OUTSIDE ","small_heading":false,"content":"<p>Preservation, reuse, and the spirit of renewal is at the core of our mission and it’s why we have products you can use to fill that hole in your tent, patch up the leak in your waders, and clean the salt water out of your wetsuit.
